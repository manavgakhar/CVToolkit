# CVToolkit

## This toolkit is built on PyTorch, MXNet and GluonCV. It can perform :
- Image Classification (ResNet-101 pretrained on Imagenet 1k)
- Object Detection (Faster-RCNN with ResNet-50 backbone pre-trained on Pascal VOC)
- Semantic Segmentation (FCN with ResNet-101 backnone pre-trained on Pascal VOC)

## Clone the repository and use *streamlit run app.py* to run the app locally
